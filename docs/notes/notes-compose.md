## Key Concepts

### Composables
- Functions annotated with `@Composable`
- Build UI declaratively
- Recomposition: UI updates when state changes

### State Management
- State hoisting: lift state to common ancestor
- `remember` - cache values during recomposition
- `mutableStateOf` - create observable state

### Side Effects
- `LaunchedEffect` - run suspend functions
- `DisposableEffect` - cleanup when composable leaves composition

## Common Patterns

### TODO: Add patterns as you learn them
